""" This module solves the following requirements and relies on the file
    test/6-main.py

Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
    - Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
    - You are not allowed to import any module
    - Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you don't need to
      go through all numbers to find a peak)
    - 6-peak.py must contain the function
    - 6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)),
      O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
    - Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
