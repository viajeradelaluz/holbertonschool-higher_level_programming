# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Background Context


**Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects**

Starting from today:

- Based on the requirements of each task, **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything.
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases.
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. **But not in the implementation of them!**
- **Don’t trust the user**, always think about all possible edge cases
